****### Lipinski Project

This is a project done by GustavoHMS (/luxirio) and ArturCGS (/arturcgs) to analyse data from FDA approved drugs and its relation to Lipinski's and Veber's rules for bioavailability.

The main goal of this work is to explore the chemical space of known drugs and develop predictive models for oral bioavailability.
